I debated with myself about whether or not it was even worth posting a recipe for these potatoes. I assume most people know how to roast a potato, right? Then I remembered how my previous roommates have all reacted when they smelled these in the oven and though it couldn't hurt to share some of the not-so-secret secrets.  

These were relatively straight forward, and can be adjusted to fit your individual tastes, so I didn't take a photo of the ingredients. But you can see below for the cost breakdown for the ingredients I used: 

**Ingredient** | **Amount** | **Cost** |   **Calories**
|:------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|   -----:|
Potato	|	4	potato (~700 grams)	|	 $3.20 	|	691
Olive Oil	|	2	tbsp	|	 $0.20 	|	240
Salt	|	2	tsp	|	 $0.02 	|	0
Pepper	|	2	tsp	|	 $0.06 	|	0
Thyme	|	2	tsp	|	 $0.10 	|	0
Paprika	|	2	tsp	|	 $0.06 	|	0
Total	|	---		|	 $3.64 	|	931
Total /Serving	|	---		|	 $0.73 	|	186.2

I used this recipe in my meal prep, and it made 5 servings of about 100 grams each. However, your total amount will depend on the weight and size of the potatoes you use. 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

This really depends on your personal taste, but if you are the type of person who doesn't like potato skins then your first step can be to peel your potatoes. In my case, the potatoes I used were getting pretty old and I don't own a potato scrubber- so I went ahead and peeled them using my paring knife. 

Once they are peeled (if you opted for that route), go ahead and chop them into bite-sized portions like below.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Once the potatoes are chopped, I like to weigh out the final product to get an idea about the calorie content. For Russet potatoes, 100 grams is about 98 calories. In my case, with 704 grams, the total calories were ~690. If you don't have a kitchen scale to measure your potatoes, I usually guesstimate that one russet potato is around 170 calories. 

From here, it is pretty simple. All you need to do is preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and add a couple tablespoons of the oil of your choice to a pan. From there, just add your potatoes and top with your favorite seasonings! For me, I added garlic salt, pepper, thyme, and paprika. 

Go ahead and dive hands-first to give it all a good mix (or use a spoon if you're a more sanitary person).

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Cook the potatoes for about 40 minutes, until you can poke them with a fork and they are soft. Since I made these for a meal prep, I opted to undercook them a little because I knew I would re-heat them before eating.

Then you are all done! These can be a nice snack on their own, or as a small part of a bigger dish. 

For my week 5 meal prep, I made this dish as a side to [Poor Man's Pad Thai](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/PoorManPadThai/). If you are interested, [click here](http://underwriteyourlife.com/Week5Evaluation/) to see how this dish held up over the course of a week!
