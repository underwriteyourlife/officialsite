# Mediterranean Veggie Wraps

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Meal Prep/Week 7/MedVeg Wraps/4.5 Finished Product3.jpg">

This is a lunch box that I ate for about a month before I began meal-prepping. I didn't use any specific recipe, instead I just kinda used what sounded good and what was available at Trader Joe (I don't work for Trader Joes, I promise!). I've made this recipe using chicken thighs but ultimately with the hummus and tzatziki it was just too expensive all combined, and when push comes to shove I will pick sauces over meat any day. 

Regardless, this meal is a staple in my recipe excel-sheet and I'm excited to pass it along!Click here](http://underwriteyourlife.com/meal%20prep/Week7Evaluation/) to read more about how the lunch box held up over Week 7.

This made me 5 lunch boxes for the week!

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

This is a pretty easy meal to prepare for the week. The first thing I do is boil 5 eggs to eat on the side and prepare the wraps while they are cooking. 

So go ahead and boil some water and cook your eggs for about 10 minutes (or until your preference of doneness). 

While the eggs are boiling, chop your tomatoes into squares.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

The actual process of creating the wraps is pretty simple if you make a line-up of your ingredients. I lay out all of the parts of the wrap so I can just go down the line and add ingredients as I see fit. 

First, I add the sauces: Hummus and Tzatziki, about 1 tbsp of each sauce for each wrap.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Next, I add the filling itself. This means adding a handful of chopped tomatoes (about .5 roma tomato per wrap), sprinkling a few raisins over the top, and completing the wrap with some TJ cabbage and carrot mix. 

This might seem like it is a lot of tomato, but don't worry! I promise it doesn't taste like tomato. In all honesty, I'm not sure how to describe the taste but the combination of the hummus and tomato makes the wrap completely delicious. I'm not a huge tomato fan and I will devour these wraps come lunch time.

And that's it! Serve them with your hard-boiled egg and a side of baby carrots and you have a super healthy and filling lunch that only puts you back about $2.55 and 553 calories.
