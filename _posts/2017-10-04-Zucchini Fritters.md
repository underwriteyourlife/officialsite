# Zucchini and Onion Fritters

There's nothing better than a delicious dish that is crunchy, satisfying, and full of vegetables. At least, that was what I was going for when I dreamt up this disastrous dish. Despite my pure intentions, this dish was a nightmare. Let's take a look at where I went wrong:

In total, that is $3.16 dollars worth of ingredients and 561 calories that creates 5 inedible servings of zucchini and onion fritters. Per serving, it would be .63 cents and 112 calories... if you could stomach it. 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

The first thing I did, as usual, was collect my ingredients together then chop the ingredients that needed to be chopped. In this case, it was simply slicing the onion into rings and chopping the zucchini (see below).

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

After chopping, I poured a mixture of .25 cups of flour and 1 cup panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs) onto a plate and gently beat the two eggs into a bowl.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Using one hand, I dunked the zucchini/onion individually into the egg mixture, then mixed it with the flour/breadcrumb mixture until coated. After each was coated, I placed it onto an oiled baking sheet then cooked them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. 

<h3> Result </h3>

Obviously, the result was less-than stellar. I thought the egg mixture would soak up the flour to make a nice breading, then baking it would make a nice crunchy snack that you would never know was also healthy! However, the flour simply sat on top of the zucchini, competing with the bread crumbs for space- making the end result a floury mess. It was truly horrendous and the whole thing had to go straight into the trash.

It was especially upsetting because despite its state, the dish still smelled pretty good and I was so hungry. If I could do it over (which I may, if I happen to end up with another zucchini lying around sometime soon), I would skip on the flour and just use extra Panko breadcrumbs. Feel free to give this a try and leave me some [feedback](http://underwriteyourlife.com/feedback/) about how it goes!
