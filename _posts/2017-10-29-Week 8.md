# Week 8 Meal Prep

This week I decided to play around with my meal planning excel spreadsheet and add macros into my calculations! It took a while to consolidate the protein/carbs/fats for all my ingredients (and some remain only internet-based estimations), but over time as I buy the ingredients again I will be sure to update. Regardless, it's been fun seeing the general breakdown of my macros and becoming aware of the fact that I have been carboloading without even realizing it!

With my new macros built-in, I went full-force in an attempt to round-out my meals. Therefore, I made a chicken-based dish, [sweet and sour chicken](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Sweet-and-Sour-Chicken/) that was relatively high in protein despite it being rice-based. For lunch, I whipped up [zucchini boats](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Zucchini-Boats/) with a side of [cole slaw](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Cole-Slaw/). While the chicken and zucchini boats were definitely recommendable, however, the cole slaw was a complete and utter failure. Maybe my tastebuds were just too sweet from all the Halloween candy this week, but I ended up throwing most of it out after lunch.

Each day I ate one meal of sweet and sour chicken as well as one meal of zucchini boats with a side of cole slaw. In total, that was 1011 calories, 56 grams of protein, 130 grams of carbs, and 30 grams of fat. In other words, as a percentage of total calories eaten, I ate 60% carbs, 26% protein, and 14% fat. 

Unfortunately, this week was definitely more expensive than I expected it to be. It cost about $6.30 per day or $3.15 dollars per meal. While the sweet and sour chicken was the most expensive meal, the cole slaw ended up being a much more expensive side dish than my typical homemade bread, so I think that is what pushed the price up.
