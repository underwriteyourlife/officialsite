# Week 5 Meal Prep

This past week was my birthday weekend, so unfourtunately, I didn't have a lot of time to plan out a new meal prep. However, it did give me a nice excuse to break out some old favorite dishes from my previous weeks of meal prep that I didn't yet document! 

First, I decided to bake-up an old favorite treat of mine, [rosemary honey pull-apart rolls](/recipe/Rosemary-Honey-Pull-Apart-Rolls/ "Rosemary Honey Pull-Apart Rolls") to snack on in the morning at work. While the bread rose, I decided to make another 5 servings of [chicken curry salad](/recipe/ChickenCurrySalad/ "Chicken Curry Salad") for lunch. I loved eating it so much last week and I already had all the ingredients that I couldn't think of a reason not to make them again.

Lastly, I used my left-over ingredients from a few weeks ago to make [poor man's Pad Thai](/recipe/PoorManPadThai/ "Poor Man's Pad Thai") with a side of [seasoned roasted russet potatoes](/recipe/RoastedSeasonedPotatoes/ "Seasoned Roasted Russet Potatoes"). 

The week cost a total of $2.52 per meal and all together represent 1412 kcal/day (382 for chicken curry salad  [130 of which are from the crackers], 511 for pad thai, 186 for roasted potatoes, and 333 for 4 rosemary rolls).

In case you don't want to click on each recipe individually, all the ingredients you'll need to make this week's meal prep are below:
