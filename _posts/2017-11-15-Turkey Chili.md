# Turkey Chili

A good classic chili always has some sort of beans in it. Your beef chili usually has some pinto beans, your white chili has some cannellini beans, and your red chili maybe some kidney beans. But what about Turkey Chili? Northern beans? Black beans? How about... no beans!

Woah woah woah, hold up, I know you're getting your pitchforks ready for a good recipe-whippin after reading that. And to be honest, I don't have a good excuse for why this chili doesn't have any beans in it other than it doesn't *need* them! This recipe is delicious and flavorful all on its own, without needed an extra filler from beans. I always prefer loading up my chili with lots of veggies and potato to give each bite that extra crunch. 

But to each their own, I guess.

These ingredients produced 5 servings of 1.5 cups of Turkey Chili each (lettuce on the side) for $2.59 USD per meal. 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Firstly, go ahead and chop your potatoes, green bell peppers, tomatoes, green onions, onion, and garlic. You can also slice your lime if you'd like- I serve a lime slice on the side of my dish. 

Additionally, I weigh my potatoes in order to ensure the most accurate calorie-count.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

In a large pan, sauté your garlic along with a little oil for about 1 minute before adding in all of your ground turkey. While the turkey cooks, add in your seasoning (salt, pepper, chili powder, and cumin) and stir until the turkey is cooked.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the turkey has been cooked, add in your tomatoes, peppers, and potato one at a time. I prefer to wait a few minutes between each addition to ensure they have been fully incorporated. 

Cook until the tomatoes have broken down into a nice sauce and the potato is soft enough to be poked through with a fork.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Next, add the carrots and onion then cook for about 7 minutes until the onion is translucent. Add an entire can of diced green chilies and then simmer, with a lid on the pan, for another 10 minutes. Taste and add seasonings according to your preference.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

While the chili is simmering, go ahead and chop your lettuce. I prefer to serve this on the side of my dish that way when I eat it later in the week for lunch, I can add in the lettuce after re-heating and it'll be deliciously crunchy!

Serve your chili with toppings of green onions or whatever you like!
