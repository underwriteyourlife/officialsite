# Yakitori Don

I found a delicious looking recipe on <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/27953/yakitori-don/" target="_blank">All Recipes</a> that I thought would taste delicious and take advantage of the ingredients I already had on-hand. However, as a forewarning, this recipe does need to marinate overnight- so plan ahead before you make it!

What I didn't realize, is that by adding some veggies to make it more of a meal and saut√©ing the meat instead of grilling, is that I was essentially creating the classic default meal-prep dinner of chicken and broccoli. That being said, chicken and broccoli is a meal-prep favorite because of its cheapness, high protein content, and ease of cooking- so I supposed I can't complain. Besides, the Yakitori Don flavors were delicious!

All together, this made 5 servings of chicken and broc- oh, I mean yakitori don, for $2.80 dollars per meal. 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Since the chicken needs to marinate overnight, I did the first step the day before meal-prepping. I chopped my ginger, garlic, and chicken then added that to a bowl of my marinade. 

The marinade consists of the entirety of the soy sauce, sugar, rice vinegar, and mirin. Traditional Yakitori Don uses Sake instead of rice vinegar, but I already had rice vinegar on hand and I absolutely love its flavor. 

Add the chopped chicken, garlic, and ginger to the marinade, cover, and let rest in the refrigerator overnight.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

The next morning, I took the marinade out of the refrigerator, stirred it, and let it rest on the counter while I chopped the remaining green onion and onion.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the ingredients were prepared, I heated the oil over a large skillet and cooked the chicken (retaining the rest of the marinade for use later on). It took about 5-7 minutes for the chicken fully cook.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Once the chicken was cooked, I added the broccoli and onion, stirring for about 4 minutes until they had both cooked down. At this point, I added in the rest of the marinade and covered with a lid to allow the mixture to simmer for another ~8 minutes, until the marinade had thickened to create a savory sauce.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

I served the Yakitori Don alongside 1 cup of white rice. I sprinkled the top with the green onion and a little cilantro- but that is completely up to your personal tastes!

The meal was super delicious and easy to make- as long as you have the foresight to marinate the chicken overnight! I will definitely be making this again.
