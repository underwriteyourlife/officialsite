# Red Onion Mashed Potatoes

You may wonder: how can you possibly screw up mashed potatoes? They are mashed potatoes for Christ's sake- its not rocket science! Well, apparently it's too hard for my little brain because I thought adding Vanilla Almond Milk would be an acceptable substitute for heavy cream or literally anything else. Then I froze them. It MIGHT have been ok if I dind't try to freeze them first... maybe. But the vanilla almond milk flavor with the horrible texture after thawing was just hilariously bad. 

That being said... I did eat it. Maybe I am just too hungry or a total cheapsake but dammit I ate those potatoes every day this week. For that, I am proud. 

So you can stop reading here, I'm not sure why you would want instructions on how to make the world's worst mashed potatoes.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

As usual, the first thing I did was weigh out my potatoes and chop the red onion.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Next, I boiled the red potatoes for about 25 minutes (until entirely soft). I drained the water, added the almond milk and red onion, then used a fork to mash the enture mixture together.

Once it was fully incorporated, I let it cool, packed it in a huge ziplock bag, and froze the entire thing since I knew I wasn't going to be eating it for another week. 

1/10 would not reccomend putting almond milk into your mashed potatoes. Obviously.
