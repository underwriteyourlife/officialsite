# Coconut Curry Lentils

Ready to get stewin'? Lord knows I wasn't when I started this dish. These coconut curry lentils will be worth the extra cooking time, however, as they are packed with flavor and hold up really well over the course of a week ([click here](http://underwriteyourlife.com/meal%20prep/Week4Evaluation/) to see the review of how they performed in meal prep Week 4!)

The original recipe is on [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/2016/07/slow-cooker-coconut-curry-lentils/) and requires a slow cooker. However, if you are like me (AKA: inefficient and poor) and thus don't own a slow cooker, you can cook these on the stovetop. However, if you have a slow cooker, just add all the ingredients (except the rice and cilantro- you'll have to cook that separately) and set to cook at high for 4-5 hours. 

Here are the ingredients you'll need to cook this dish! All together it made 6.5 servings of 1.5 cups each (or just under 10 cups total), with each serving costing $1.87 and putting you back 656 calories.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

I always like to just go ahead and chop up all my ingredients to get the hard stuff out of the way first. So, firstly, dice your onions and green onions (without mixing them), mince your garlic, peel and dice your sweet potato, cut your carrots in any way that suits your fancy, then slice those tomatoes.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Next, if you have a slow-cooker, throw everything except the rice, cilantro, green onions, and coconut milk on high for 4-5 hours. If you don't, pull out your biggest pot, and cook the white onion, carrots, and garlic for about three minutes. 

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once those have cooked down (the carrots should be slightly softer and the onion relatively see-through, about 3-5 minutes), add the diced tomatoes, diced sweet potato, curry powder, cloves, can of tomatoes, 3 cups of water, and 3 vegetable bouillon cubes (you can opt to use 3 cups of vegetable broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes).

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Let that cook down for about 3 minutes, then add in your 2 cups of lentils. I used green lentils because they were the cheapest and most readily accessible to me, however, you can use any that you'd like! One of the best things about this dish is that you are able to customize it to fit your personal tastes.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>
While this was cooking, I used my rice cooker to make the rice! I added three cups of dry rice plus 3.5 cups of water to my rice cooker, and this created 6 cups of rice exactly! I topped the rice with some cilantro and green onions then served it in my meal prep containers. 

<h2> Step 6 </h2>

Let it cook! I cooked mine on the stove top for about 1-2 hours. However, I realized pretty late into it that my gas bill was going to be exorbitant if I kept using the stove top like that, so I decided to just stick a lid on it and let it sit in its own warmth. I kept an eye on the mixture until it was fully thickened (all the water had been cooked through), which was about 30 minutes. After that, I added the entire can of coconut milk (YUM). I turned back on the stove top on low for an additional 10 minutes, until the coconut milk had thickened. 

I let this whole mixture cool then put it into individual serving containers for lunch! The additional .75 cups I had left over, I put into a container to freeze for later. Don't forget to top the servings with some chopped red and green onions!
