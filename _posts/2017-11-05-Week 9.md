# Week 9 Meal Prep

Last week I decided I was going to buy groceries not only for the following week, but for the week after that as well. The idea was cutting down on the time I spent at the grocery store and allowing myself to spend more time traveling over the weekend. However, this posed an interesting problem for me when I went grocery shopping two weeks ago, since I had to think of meals for which the ingredients wouldn't go bad if I didn't use them until the following week.

Did that make sense? 

Regardless, this week is the result of that little problem. All the ingredients I used to make this meal prep were bought a week in advance, which ruled out using any meat (I could've frozen them but I ultimately decided against it). So this week I whipped up two vegetarian dishes: Veggie Lasagna with a side of Baguette for lunch and Cauliflower Green Thai Curry with a side of rice for dinner. 

IT WAS SO GOOD. I don't want you to think that I am just saying that because I have a blog and of course I think my own cooking is good. That's not the case at all. In fact, I think most of the time I'm pretty good about admitting how mediocre my food is... But this week was different. I am definitely going to make both of these dishes again in the future- they were cheap, easy, and oh so good.

All together I had 5 servings of cauliflower green thai curry, 6 servings of lasagna, and 8 servings (2 1-inch slices each) of baguette. For 11 meals, the price came out to $4.34 per day or $2.18 per meal- pretty good!
