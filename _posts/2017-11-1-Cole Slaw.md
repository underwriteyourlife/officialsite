# Cole Slaw

All I can say is that I guess I cut too many corners when it came to making this Cole Slaw inspried by [Robert Irving](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/robert-irvine/cole-slaw-recipe0-1947123). I served it as a side dish to my [Zucchini Boats]() but honestly I ended up throwing it out most days around lunchtime. Luckily leftover halloween candy was a nice replacement. 

If you were going to take a stab at fixing where I went wrong, I would say the best place to start would be using more sugar, a real mayonnaise (not Miracle Whip), and avoiding the Broccoli Slaw.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

On the bright side, this is a really easy dish to make. Just empty out your lettuce/slaw mix (or chop your ingredients) into a bowl and squeeze the juice of half of a lemon over the mixture. Use a spoon to give it a quick toss.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Next, pour your vinegar and mayo over the mixture (5 tbsp of vinegar and ~12 tbsp of mayo or until fully coated). Give that a quick mix.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Lastly, add your raisins and spices to taste. Ensure the whole bowl has been fully mixed. You can eat it now, but I let it sit in the fridge overnight to ensure the slaw softened and soaked up all the flavor.

Like I said, there were a lot of corners I cut in trying to make this dish a little more healthy. I wouldn't reccomend making it the same way that I did. There's a reason why cole slaw isn't known as a healthy food, and maybe some things shouldn't change.
