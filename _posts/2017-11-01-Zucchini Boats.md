# Zucchini Boats

I have made a cheaper version of these zucchini boats in the past by just hollowing out a zucchini and filling its insides with cheese/pasta sauce to make a delicious dinner. However, I knew I could take it up a notch. In all honesty, this recipe is like the kitchen sink of recipes, where I just added in whatever I had sitting around in my pantry- but the results were surprisingly delicious!

I didn't end up using the insides of the zucchini and squashes in the mixture (because I am not a huge fan of the taste) but you can add these back into the filling to suit your preferences.

With one zucchini or squash per meal, this creates 5 lunches for $2.37 per lunch. Just be careful- it is pretty low calorie because of the vegetables- be sure you are pairing this with something more filling, otherwise your stomach will be growling by 3pm!

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

As usual, the first thing I do is chop all my ingredients. I chopped the tomatoes, red onion, and cut the zucchini/squash down the middle. 

Then began the hard part- and I don't want the simple photos below to negate how tedious this part was. You need to use a spoon to hollow-out the insides of the zucchini and squashes. However, you need to be careful because it is really easy to accidentally cut through the bottom and ruin the whole "boat" thing.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

This isn't hard but it is very important. Next season the heck out of the hollowed zucchini and squashes. The last thing you want is for your lunch to taste like vegetables. Yuk. 

I spray some oil and sprinkle salt and pepper then pre-bake them at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Combine your other ingredients (the hummus, tomato, onion, panko, 2 tbsp marinara sauce, and seasonings to taste) in a bowl and stir. Once they are incorporated, add in about 1/2 of your cheese and stir until fully mixed.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Lastly, package this filling into the boats then drizzle with your remaining cheese and marinara sauce. Bake the boats for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees.
