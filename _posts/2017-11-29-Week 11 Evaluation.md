# Week 11 Meal Prep Evaluation

Week 11's meal prep could have been better, but it also could have been worse. The star of the show as definitely the Jambalaya since it froze so well and reheated with no problems. As a reminder, because this week was Thanksgiving, I made food for two weeks ahead of time and stuck it in the freezer so I could pop it out when I needed it.

# [Jambalaya](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Jambalaya/)

After cooking the Jambalaya, I stuck the 5 servings into individual ziplock bags and stuck them in the freezer. The dish froze really well! It thawed quickly overnight and heated up in my work's microwave without a problem. I got a little sick of sausage at the beginning of the week, but by the time Friday came around I was wolfing the dish down.

# [Meatloaf](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Cheesy-Meatloaf/) with [Mashed Potatoes](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Red-Onion-Mashed-Potatoes/)

So, this looks horrible, I'm not even going to try to pretend that any of these photos look appetizing. In fact, I probably won't be making this again purely based off how it looks despite the fact that the meatloaf held up pretty well over the week. 

Additionally, freezing the meatloaf seemed to help with the fat content. When I took it out of the oven it wasn't able to keep its shape, but after wrapping and freezing the loaf it seemed to congeal better. It was a good freezer-friendly dish, but I don't think I could get another person to eat it if their life depended on it.
