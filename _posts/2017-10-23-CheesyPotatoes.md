# Cheesy Potatoes with Corn

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Meal Prep/Week 7/Cheesy Potato and Corn/Closeup5.jpg">

I combined butter, potatoes, corn, and cheese to make a deceptively delicious side-dish to serve alongside my Week 7's [lo mein](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/LoMein/). [Click here](http://underwriteyourlife.com/meal%20prep/Week7Evaluation/) to read more about how these potatoes held up over Week 7.

This made me 6 servings of ~1 cup each.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

The first step for me is always to wash and weigh my potatoes. I like to know exactly how many grams of Russet Potatoes I use so I can get a more accurate calorie count, however, its definitely not necessary and you can just estimate about 170 kcalories for each potato. 

Once they are weighed, go ahead and scallop the potatos (use a knife to cut them across the short-edge to make circles).

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Next, melt 1 tbsp of butter or margarine in a large pan over high heat. Add your scalloped potatoes, mix until the butter covers the potatoes, and cover in order to steam and cook the potatoes thoroughly.

(You can also opt to just gently fry the potatoes in the butter until they are crispy on the outside and stick the whole pan in the oven to bake until cooked through if that's your preference)

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

While the potatoes are cooking go ahead and add your seasonings (salt and pepper, or additional seasonings to taste) and mix until they cover the potatoes. 

Continue to cook until the potatoes feel soft when poked with a fork (some may lose their scalloped shape).

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Once your potatoes are cooked, add your corn, and heat just until the corn is mixed and warm (about 2-3 minutes).

Take the pan off heat and sprinkle your cheese on top of the potatoes, using your spatula to mix the cheese in with the corn and potatoes. The residual heat should melt the cheese without burning anything.

Thats it! Its a quick and easy side dish that will have you looking forward to eating your dinner every night of meal prep! In fact, once I'm done writing this I'm going to go home and eat some myself!
