# Week 12 Meal Prep

If you can believe it, I actually didn't plan on making this week Italian themed. But let's embrace it! 

So for this week I cooked up some [Italian Wedding Soup](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Italian-Wedding-Soup/) that ended up being a little more like chicken broth-soaked pasta, [Italian Sausage with Peppers and Onions](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Italian-Sausage-and-Peppers/), with some [Baguette](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Baguettes/) on the side. 

Overall, this week cost about $1.92 dollars per meal for lunch and dinner for Monday-Friday.
