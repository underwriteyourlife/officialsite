# Week 7 Meal Prep

I had an extra set of hands this weekend to help with meal prep, so I decided to take advantage of the situation and make a dish that is much easier with two people: [Chinese-Style Pork Dumplings](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/ChineseStylePorkDumplings). My original plan was to serve these alongside some [Lo Mein](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/LoMein) for a Chinese-inspired dinner for the week, however, we accidentially ate them all...

Instead, I opted to serve the Lo Mein with a side of [Cheesy-Potatoes with Corn](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/CheesyPotatoes/) since I had a ton of potatoes left-over from the previous Week's [Potato Tikka Masala](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/PotatoTikkaMasala/). 

For lunch, I whipped out a recipe that I've used tons of times before but never actually documented. I call it [Mediterranean Veggie Wraps](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/MediterraneanVeggieWraps) because if I call it what it truly is, Tomato Wraps, no one would want to eat it. Rest assured, it does not taste like tomatoes despite it being a staple of this vegetarian lunch.

In case you don't want to click on each recipe individually, all the ingredients you'll need to make this week's meal prep as well as the nutritional information are below:

This made me 5 servings of Lo Mein (~1.5 cups each), 6 servings of Cheesy Potatoes (1 cup each), and 5 Wrap lunch boxes. Ultimately, this made me 10 meals for about $2.5 dollars per meal. This week was a little bit more expensive than weeks in the past because of the expensive ingredients to make the wraps. Personally, the addition of Tzatziki really knocks it up a notch, however, to make 10 wraps you'l end up using about half a container. To cut back on the price you can definitely leave the Tzatziki out or make your own sauces!

In terms of calories, each serving of Lo Mein = 419.2 calories, Cheesy Potatoes = 246.2 calories, and Wrap Lunch = 553 calories.
