# Week 7 Meal Prep

I had an extra set of hands this weekend to help with meal prep, so I decided to take advantage of the situation and make a dish that is much easier with two people: [Chinese-Style Pork Dumplings](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Homemade-Pork-Dumplings/). My original plan was to serve these alongside some [Lo Mein](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/LoMein) for a Chinese-inspired dinner for the week, however, we we accidentally ate them all...

Instead, I opted to serve the Lo Mein with a side of [Cheesy-Potatoes with Corn](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/CheesyPotatoes/) since I had a ton of potatoes left-over from the previous Week's [Potato Tikka Masala](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/PotatoTikkaMasala/). 

For lunch, I whipped out a recipe that I've used tons of times before but never actually documented. I call it [Mediterranean Veggie Wraps](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/MediterraneanVeggieWraps) because if I call it what it truly is, Tomato Wraps, no one would want to eat it. Rest assured, it does not taste like tomatoes despite it being a staple of this vegetarian lunch.
