# Homemade Chinese Pork Dumplings

This is a big undertaking if you are making these alone, so I definitely recommend pulling in a friend or roommate to help! While I opted to make the dough from scratch, for a more edible product you are likely better off just buying some pre-made dumpling wrappers. 

I tried cooking these both steamed and fried- unless you are able to make your dough super thin, it's probably better just to fry them up. Additionally, I wish I had added more salt/flavoring to the dough because with the additional thickness it was pretty bland. 

Despite all this, I was actually pleasantly surprised about how these turned out! They didn't even make it to meal prep before being gobbled up.

I have to admit, I didn't count how many dumplings were made. However, I divided the dough into 4 sections and my best guess is that I got 10 dumplings from each section. Either way, I decided to stay conservative and calculate based on 30 dumplings. With that assumption, its about .28 cents and 97 calories per dumpling. 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Start off by boiling 1 cup of water. This was the first time I have used hot water in my baking and I found the texture that was derived from the addition made this dough perfect for dumplings. I can't tell you why but I guess this step is important.

Add the boiling water to two cups of flour and stir until mixed.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Next, add a half a cup of room temperature water and knead on the counter. Cover your hands and the working surface in flour and knead until the dough is fully formed and slightly sticky. Give it a quick poke, just for fun. 

Let the dough rest while you continue with the next steps.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Chop your green onions, garlic, and cabbage. Take the napa cabbage and use a cloth to squeeze out the excess water.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

In a large bowl, add the seasonings, garlic, green onion, napa cabbage, and ground pork. Use your hand or spatula to fully mix these ingredients together to form the filling of your dumplings.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

Once your filling is made, take your rested dough, re-knead, and divide it into four equal sections.

<h2> Step 6 </h2>

Use the palms of your hands to roll out one section of dough into a line. USe a knife to chop this line into 10 even sections. 

Use your hands or a rolling-pin to flatten out each section of dough into a small circle. Make this circle as thin as possible: you may need to add additional flour to prevent sticking.

Repeat this process for each section of dough.

<h2> Step 7 </h2>

Take a small amount of the filling (about 1 tbsp) and add it to the inside of the dumpling circle. Use your hands to hold the dumpling like a taco and pinch the seams together with your index finger and thumb, folding along the crease.

I'm definitely not an expert in dumpling-folding so my best suggestion is just ot try to seal them as best as possible.

<h2> Step 8 </h2>

You can choose to skip this step if you are planning on frying your dumplings and move to step 9. 

I used my rice cooker to act as a steamer for the dumplings. I added the uncooked dumplings to the steaming tray and set my rice cooker to steam for about 15 minutes. If you do not have a steamer you can always boil a pot of water and use a tray to hold the dumplings above the steam.

<h2> Step 9 </h2>

In order to fry the dumplings, add the oil to a pan over high heat. Add the dumplings to the heated pan, ensuring that the dumpling is cooked thoroughly (about 8-10 minutes).

And there you have it! They aren't particularly pretty, and I'm sure you can add your own improvements, but it gets the job done:
