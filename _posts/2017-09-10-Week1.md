# Week 1 Meal Prep

I was inspired by the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday" target= "_blank"> r/MealPrepSunday </a> to begin meal prepping my food. Because of this, I decided to tackle a Reddit-approved favorite for lunch this week: the classic [burrito bowl](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/). Then I remembered I didn't have money to load it up with chicken or ground beef, so I decided to make it vegetarian! 

Since I started going to the gym and lifting weights, I have been craving peanut butter. So for dinner I wanted to find a way to incorporate an absurd amount of peanut butter without eating it straight from the jar and weirding out my roommate. That is how I came up with [peanut noodles](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/)! Essentially it is all my favorite things crammed into one dish: high fat, high carb, low nutritional value (however, I top it with some veggies to make it look better). 

[Read my review](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/) about how Week 1's meals held up!

In total, this produced 10 meals for me (5 lunches and 5 dinners) for a total of ~$20 dollars ($2.05 dollars per meal), including the side dishes of cucumber and roasted sweet potato. All together the Burrito Bowl lunch was 621 calories and the Peanut Noodle dinner was 473 calories.
