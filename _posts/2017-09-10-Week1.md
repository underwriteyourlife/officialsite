# Week 1 Meal Prep

I was inspired by the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday" target= "_blank"> r/MealPrepSunday </a> to begin meal prepping my food. Because of this, I decided to tackle a Reddit-approved favorite for lunch this week: the classic [burrito bowl](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/). Then I remembered I didn't have money to load it up with chicken or ground beef, so I decided to make it vegetarian! 

Since I started going to the gym and lifting weights, I have been craving peanut butter. So for dinner I wanted to find a way to incorporate an absurd amount of peanut butter without eating it straight from the jar and weirding out my roommate. That is how I came up with [peanut noodles](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/)! Essentially it is all my favorite things crammed into one dish: high fat, high carb, low nutritional value (however, I top it with some veggies to make it look better). 

[Read my review](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/) about how Week 1's meals held up!

In case you don't want to click on each recipe individually, all the ingredients you'll need to make this week's meal prep are below:



In total, this produced 10 meals for me (5 lunches and 5 dinners) for a total of $24 dollars ($2.4 dollars per meal), including the side dishes of cucumber and roasted sweet potato. All together the Burrito Bowl lunch was 621 calories and the Peanut Noodle dinner was 473 calories.
