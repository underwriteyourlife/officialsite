# Week 1 Meal Prep

I was inspired by the subreddit [r/mealprepsunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/) to begin meal prepping my food. Because of this, I decided to tackle a Reddit-approved favorite for lunch this week: the classic [burrito bowl](/feedback/). Then I remembered I didn't have money to load it up with chicken or ground beef, so I decided to make it vegetarian! 

Since I started going to the gym and lifting weights, I have been craving peanut butter. So for dinner I wanted to find a way to incorporate absurds amounts of peanut butter without eating it straight from the jar and weirding out my roommate. That is how I came up with [peanut noodles](/feedback/)! Essentially it is all my favorite things crammed into one dish: high fat, high carb, low nutritional value (however, I top it with some veggies to make it look better).
