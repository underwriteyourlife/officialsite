# Week 8 Meal Prep Evaluation

# [Sweet and Sour Chicken](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Sweet-and-Sour-Chicken/)

The sweet and sour chicken held up well throughout the week. The brown rice didn't get as stiff as my usual side of white rice, so that was a nice, unexpected, change from week to week. 

I ultimately ended up eating my last serving of this 8 days after it was cooked (since I visited my friends Friday-Sunday this weekend) and to my surprise the chicken was still good! I feel reinvigorated to continue to use chicken in my meal preps- I am usually cautious because of my fear of eating chicken that has gone bad and getting sick. 

Rest assured, leaving your cooked chicken for a week in the fridge will not make you sick (in my experience).

# [Zucchini Boats](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Zucchini-Boats/) and [Cole Slaw](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Cole-Slaw/) 

The zucchini boats and cole slaw were another story. In all honesty, I can't really speak to how well the cole slaw held up over the course of the week because I didn't eat a lot of it. I can attest that it did get more vinegar-y as the week went on but the slaw itself held its crunch pretty well. 

The boats got a little soggy from waiting in the fridge all week, but the flavor was still pretty delicious. I loved the mixture of panko and sauce- the texture and flavor made me feel like I was eating ground beef, which was a pleasant surprise. It didn't occur to me to use ground beef in this dish, but if I ever re-make it then I think I will do that next time. What was also a pleasant surprise was the fact that the hummus flavor wasn't too overwhelming and didn't throw off the balance of the dish! Overall, I was pretty impressed.
