# Cheesy Meatloaf

So I was inspired after reading [this](https://www.rachaelraymag.com/recipe/cheeseburger-meatloaf-and-mashed-potatoes) recipe by Rachael Ray to make some meatloaf with a side of [mashed potatoes](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Red-Onion-Mashed-Potatoes/) for dinner this week. When I pulled this sucker out of the oven, my only reaction was "Why Rachael? Why have you lied to me like this?"

I followed the recipe to a tee (although I think using 80/20 ground beef was a mistake) and it looked absolutely horrid while I was baking it. Since I made this in coordination with my [week 11](http://underwriteyourlife.com/meal%20prep/Week-11/) meal prep, I actually ended up freezing the meatloaf and eating it the following week because I was traveling for Thanksgiving. Rachael Ray didn't do me completely wrong, however, as this actually ended up tasting way better than it looked! I guess you can't judge a book by its cover, or in this case, a recipe by its ingredients.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

This is such a weird thing to make. Who was the first person who was like "yeah lets mash up some beef with ketchup and pickles then eat it!". But as I was writing that it occurred to me that I kinda just described a bunless-hamburger, so I guess it's not that odd. 

Anyways, the first thing I did was chop up the onion and pickles. 

In a seprate bowl I added the eggs, panko, and ketchup. You can also add in any seasonings of you choice at this point as well!

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

In order to get an accurate calorie and macro-count for this dish, I went ahead and weighed out the ground beef and cheese before mixing it into the bowl.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the meat and cheese was weighed, I added them into the bowl along with the pickles and onion then incorporated all of the ingredients together. I used my (clean) hands since that was the easiest way to mix everything, but when I was done mixing the whole thing looked so disgusting that I was really beginning to question my life choices.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Lastly, I poured the mixture into pans lined with tin-foil and baked for 40-50 minutes until fully cooked. Since I used 80/20 ground beef, the whole mixture was kinda fatty and "liquidy" but it hardened up as it cooled down- I would recommend using a lower fat content ground beef before baking!

Once it was cooked, I let the loaves cool on the counter top before wrapping them entirely in tin-foil and sticking them in the freezer to eat next week. Overall it wasn't too bad! The portion sizes (it made 6 for me) were a little small but still super filling.
