# Cauliflower Green Thai Curry

So this is a recipe I found out of a book, and sadly I don't have the book anymore but I did find the recipe [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=jvSeAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT274&lpg=PT274&dq=marie+arnold+thai+curry&source=bl&ots=1_SMx3-74M&sig=hd_2W_CswHG4XUplOZy6MrjmQ40&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwie46aG1bTXAhVC6iYKHcEKADYQ6AEIODAG#v=onepage&q=marie%20arnold%20thai%20curry&f=false). The original recipe calls for this dish to be made as a Red Thai Curry, but I'm all about those Green Thai flavors, so I decided to just take my own spin on things. 

The end result was absolutely delicious- I will surely make this again and I can't say I would change anything about it (except for maybe making more of it!). The recipe made 5 servings of 1.5 cups each, 592 calories per serving. [Click here](LINK) to see how the curry held up over the week.

If you don't include the rice, the macros are much better at 59% carb, 21% protein, and 20% fat.

All together the meal costs $11.50, or $2.30 per meal. Pretty good considering it tastes like something you could get at a restaurant!

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Firstly, I went ahead and chopped all my ingredients. This included all the onions (red, white, and green!), the garlic, the potatoes, and the red bell peppers. In order to chop the cauliflower, I held the head upside down (stem facing up) and cut downwards with a knife, letting the leafy part fall off into a bowl without a majority of the stem. 

I also weighed out my potatoes to get an accurate calorie count, as usual.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Once you have chopped your ingredients, pour about half of your coconut milk into a pan and bring to a simmer. Once it has thickened slightly, add your green thai curry spices and stir to incorporate. I used a pre-mixed spice packet because it was cheaper than buying the individual spices (however, it was pretty good so that might be an investment I should make over the long-term). If you choose to mix your own spices, I think typical Green Thai Curry seasoning is a combination of lemongrass, ginger, cumin, coriander, garlic, and basil, although I have never done it myself so you'll probably have to google it (sorry!).

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the spices have been incorporated, add your chopped white onion and garlic, mix, then add your potatoes. I used golden potatoes because they cook much quicker than russet potatoes and they taste more mild to me, which really allowed the spices to be the star of the show. 

Cook until the potato is soft but not falling apart- about 7 minutes. 

Once the potato is cooked, add your cauliflower. My pan wasn't big enough to mix it all together immediately, so I opted to put a lid on the curry and let the cauliflower steam until they had wilted down and could be stirred. This took about 10 minutes.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Once the cauliflower is cooked through, add your red bell pepper and incorporate. Cook just until the bell pepper begins to wilt. Give it a taste and make sure the texture is how you like it- if you prefer soft veggies (like me) you can cook for longer until the cauliflower begins to breakdown.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

Lastly, taste and then add your favorite seasonings as you see fit. I love salt and pepper so I added that to my final product. Serve the curry with a side of white rice (I used ~1.5 cups of curry for 1 cup of rice). Top with the raw red and green onion then chow down!
