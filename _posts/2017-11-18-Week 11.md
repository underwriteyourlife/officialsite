# Week 11 Meal Prep

For this week I decided to whip up Rachel Ray's recipe for [meatloaf](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Cheesy-Meatloaf/) with a side of [mashed potatoes](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Red-Onion-Mashed-Potatoes/). Don't even bother wasting your time by clicking on the mashed potatoes because I tried to add almond milk and it was absolutely horrendous. 

However, the lunch serving of [jambalaya](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Jambalaya/) was more than enough to make up for the potatoes mishap! Overall this week cost $2.74 dollars per meal and wasn't too bad, all considered. I will definitely be making the jambalaya again, assuming I can get my hands on some cheaper sausage.
