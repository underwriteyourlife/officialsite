Since this week was a lazy week for me, I decided to whip up a few servings of pad thai for my meal prep. I had all the ingredients left over from [Week 2's meal prep](http://underwriteyourlife.com/week2/) so this was a great low-cost way to make dinner. Most people probably don't have some of these ingredients just lying around their kitchen, so it may be a higher up-front cost, however, once you invest in buying these staples they will last you a while and ensure that you can make Pad Thai whenever the desire hits you!

In total, that is $7.55 US dollars worth of ingredients and 2554 calories. For me this made 5 servings of Pad Thai, so in total it was about $1.5 dollars per serving with each serving being 511 calories. 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Firstly, I got a big pot of water boiling in which I could soak my rice noodles. Since we are going to 'stir-fry' them later, I bring the pot to a boil, turn off the heat, add the noodles, and just let them soak for about 5-6 minutes. Once they are finished soaking, I drain them and let them cool (we are going to use this pot later!). 

While the noodles are soaking, I chopped my onions, carrots, and green onions.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Next, I added my olive oil and garlic to a large pan to sautee. After about a minute, when the pan was fully heated, I added the onion and carrots and let the whole dish sautee over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. 

After the carrots and onion are cooked, I cracked 1 fresh egg into the pan, turned off the burner, and let the residual heat slowly cook the egg.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the egg is no longer runny, I used the same large pot in which I soaked the noodles to make the sauce. Firstly, I put .5 cups of water and 1 vegetable cube into the pot. If you do not have bouillon cubes, you can use .5-1 cups of vegetable/chicken broth. Once the cube is dissolved (or broth heated), I add the other ingredients for the sauce. 

This means adding 2 tbsp honey, 3 tsp fish sauce, 3 tbsp peanut butter, 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 4 tbsp soy sauce, and the juice of 1 lime into the bot. Let this pot come to a slow simmer before moving on. 

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Once the peanut butter is melted and the whole broth is simmering, feel free to give it a taste and adjust to your personal prefrences. I tend to add more rice vinegar, but it is completely up to you! Next, add the onion/carrot/egg sauteed mixture into the sauce and cook for 1 minute.

Once that is fully incorporated, add the cooked rice noodles along with a little bit of olive oil and 1 tbsp soy sauce to the sauce and stir until all the rice noodles are coated.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

Lastly, I add 1/4 cup of salted peanuts into a ziplock bag and use a rolling pin to crush them. I then take the crushed peanuts, roast them over high heat for about 30 seconds- 1 minute, and use them as garnish for the top of the Pad Thai. In my opinion, they provide a nice crunch!

Then you are all done! Serve the pad thai in seprate dishes, top with the peanuts/cilantro/green onion/ lime wedge as you see fit.
