# Veggie Lasagna

Now, I know you think lasagna is always better with some nice ground-up beef or pork or whatever meat you like mixed in. But this recipe is proof you don't need to break your wallet on meat in order to get a nice macro-friendly lasagna. At a price point of $1.94 dollars per meal and 450 calories (28% of which are from protein), I definitely recommend taking a stab at whipping a tray or two up.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

First things first, take our your frozen spinach and begin to thaw it in a large pan. While the spinach is cooking down, pull out those knives and chop your choppable ingredients (the tomatoes, peppers, onion, and green onions).

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Once the spinach has thawed, add your tomato and green bell peppers. Cook them over medium heat until the tomato begins to breakdown (about 10 minutes). Season with salt and pepper to taste.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the filling has cooked down, drain out the excess. If you are using "no-boil" lasagna noodles like me, keep a little liquid in the filling so that your pasta will not become stiff. If you are using lasagna noodles that you will need to boil, go ahead and cook them 2/3rds of the way through according to package instructions. 

Coat the bottom of your pan with 2 tbsp of the ricotta cheese (and oil, if your pan is not non-stick). Layer 1/3 of your lasagna noodles over the top of the ricotta. On top of the noodles, add 2 tbsp more ricotta cheese, 2 tbsp of the pasta sauce, mix together, then top with 1/3 of the raw onions.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

On top of the onions, add 1/3rd of the spinach/tomato/pepper filling and top with 2ounces of shredded cheese.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

Repeat the layering processes two more times (1/3rd of your ingredients with each layer) until the lasagna has reached the top of the pan, being sure that the last addition is the final layer of shredded cheese.

<h2> Step 6 </h2>

Cook the lasagna in a 350 degree oven for 40-45 minutes until the cheese is brown and the noodles cooked through. Cut into six individual servings and top with the green onion. Yummy!
