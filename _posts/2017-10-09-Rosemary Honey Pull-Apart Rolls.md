# Rosemary Honey Pull-Apart Rolls

While I love baking, these rolls are by far the most fun for me to bake. I am not sure if its chopping the rosemary or just playing with the delicious-smelling dough, but baking and eating these always puts a smile on my face. In addition, if you take the time to rise the dough once you've shaped the rolls, you can make them "pull-apart" rolls and impress both your roomates and yourself!

Here are the ingredients you'll need to make the savory rolls. All together it made 28 rolls, or 7 servings of 4 rolls each. For this week's (Week 5) meal prep, I actually only needed 5 servings, but I will never complain about having too many rolls.

In total, that is $2.07 dollars of ingredients and 2333 calories- meaning each roll costs about .07 cents and only 83 calories! They are eerily similar in calories to the [rolls I made last week](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/PumpkinRolls/)... but I'll try not to overthink it. 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

As with any yeast-based bread, you need to be very careful in step 1. This is the most important step to making sure that your rolls rise, and if you mess up here there's no turning back! 

Now that I've scared you, go ahead and take .5 cups of WARM water and combine it with your packet of active dry yeast. It is important that the water is mildly warm enough to activate the yeast without being too hot as to kill the yeast. For me, this usually means running the faucet until it feels warm to the touch but does not burn. 

Once you have combined the yeast and the water, sprinkle in a few pinches of sugar to support yeast-activation. If after about 5-10 minutes your yeast doesn't look like the photo on the right below, it likely means that your yeast is not activated and I suggest you start over with a new packet of yeast.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Next, while the yeast is sitting, melt 4 tbsp of margarine or butter and 1 cup of Almond Milk. I use unsweetened vanilla almond milk because I like the flavor, however, you can use any milk you'd like!

Only cook it for long enough that it is soft and melted. If it is too hot, it will kill the yeast. So be sure to let it cool a bit before moving on to the next step. 

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

While the milk/butter mixture is cooling down, chop the rosemary then add the rest of your ingredients (except the flour) into the bowl with the yeast. This means adding the 2 tbsp of honey, remaining sugar (about 6-8 tsp), 1 tbsp olive oil, chopped rosemary, and 2 tsp salt.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

After the ingredients are combined, slowly add flour to the mixture, .5 cups at a time, until you are no longer able to stir with a spoon. For me it was after the third cup (see below). When you are unable to effectively stir the mixture, place the dough on a surface and knead with your hands for about 5 minutes, adding flour as necessary to prevent it from sticking to your hands.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

Once the dough is kneaded, let the dough sit in a clean, oiled, bowl for about an hour (until it has doubled in size).

<h2> Step 6 </h2>

Once the dough has risen, rip off sections of the dough and roll between your palms. Once it is spherical, you can pinch the bottoms of the ball in order to fine-tue the shape of the roll. Place the balls close together on an oiled pan and let rise again for about 30 minutes. You can choose to not let the dough rise a second time, but letting it rise will allow the rolls to be fluffier and connect together in order to make them pull-apart rolls.

<h2> Step 7 </h2>

If you are like me, at this point you can choose to sprinkle a little more sea-salt on top of the rolls to give them an extra something. But its up to you! 

Once you're read, pop them into a preheated oven at about 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. They should be golden-brown and firm, but not burnt. If you are unsure if it is fully cooked through, you can poke the largest one with a toothpick. If it comes out clean, the roll is ready. Alternatively, my favorite method is to lightly tap the tops of the rolls with my finger. If there is a hollow sound, that means they are cooked through.

These rolls hold a special place in my heart. I don't know if they are as good to other people are they are to me, but please give them a try and let me know!
