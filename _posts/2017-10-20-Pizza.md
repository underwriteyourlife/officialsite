# Homemade Pizza

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Meal Prep/Week6/Pizza/Final Product.jpg">

I actually first made this homemade pizza when visiting my boyfriend. He was complaining because I left a few packets of yeast in his pantry and he didn't know what to do with them! Naturally, I suggested we bake something and the rest is history. 

Regardless of if you are a baker or not, if you have time to make dough then this dish is a great, sturdy, go-to meal when you are broke and need some comfort. 

While I made this for my [Week 6 Meal Prep](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/), I actually also took some of the dough and put it into muffin tins to make little pizza muffins like in the photo above. I hope to add a seprate post later explaining why this wasn't such a good idea but how it (kinda) worked out anyways.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Firstly, as with every week where I bake something, I had to rise the yeast. I added about .5 cups of warm water to 1 packet of yeast and sprinkled in a few pinches of sugar to help it activate. 

Once the yeast activated (let it sit for about 5 minutes and get fluffy), I added the oil and salt then stirred the whole mixture.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Once the oil is added, I added flour, .5 cups at a time, to the mixture. 

After about 1.5 cups of flour the mixture was too dense to stir in the bowl so I rolled it out on the counter top and kneaded it until it was sticky but held it's shape.

Let the rolled flour rise for about 1 hour in a oiled bowl until doubled in size.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the dough has finished rising, use the palms of your hands to flatten it out onto an oiled baking sheet untit it makes a thin layer of dough across the sheet. 
Do your best to flatten out as many air bubbles as possible- this may require you to knead the dough a second time.

If you like your pizza fluffy, feel free to let it rise again at this point for another half hour before baking. 

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Once you are ready to bake, cover the pizza in sauce and your favorite toppings (except the cheese), and stick in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes (until the crust begins to turn golden and can hold it's own shape).

At this point, I took out my pizza and sprinkled my cheese on top before fully baking it for another 10 minutes.

I really enjoyed this pizza as an addition to my Week 6 meal prep! It was time consuming for the dough to rise, but otherwise it was a relatively easy meal to cook and lasted a long time in the fridge.
