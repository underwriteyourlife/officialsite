# Cinnamon Raisin Bagels

I need to caveat this post by saying I love bagels. Not in the casual "oh, I love bagels" type of way, but in the "I would seriously only eat bagels and cream cheese if it was socially acceptable and I wouldn't die" type of way. Truly, a bagel with cream cheese is an amazing food: carby, sweet, fatty- everything you could ever want wrapped up in a beautiful toasted package, handed to you warm and melty on a cold winter day.

That's what I was going for. But... first tries are always failures, right? RIGHT?

So my first attempt at boiling bread didn't go as well as planned. Something is still just fundamentally wrong to me about the idea of boiling bread, but if it can produce something as delicious as a bagel I will definitely be revisiting this recipe. Please, all you educated bakers out there who may be reading this- tell me where I went wrong.

This recipe made me 7 medium-sized cinnamon raisin bagels, or about $1.15 worth of ingredients that ended up in the trash. 


<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Firstly, I activated 1 packet of active dry yeast by combining it with .5 cups of warm water and 1 tsp of sugar and letting the mixture dissolve for about 5 minutes.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>
Next, I added flour to the yeast, .5 cups at a time, until I could no longer stir with a spoon. At this point, I poured the dough out on the table and kneaded it with my hands until it was no longer sticky. For me, this was exactly 2 cups of flour.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

As I kneaded, I added in the remaining sugar and cinnamon and kneaded it to incorporate into the dough. You could add it earlier in the process, but I waited because I wasn't sure how much dough the recipe would make.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Once the cinnamon and sugar are mixed fully into the dough, put it aside in an oiled bowl to rest until doubled in size (about 1 hour).

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

After the dough as rested, re-knead it and divide the dough into equal sized balls. I decided to create 7 medium sized bagels, but the size and amount are completely up to you!

Once they are rolled into circles, use your thumb and forefinger to create a hole on the inside of the bagel and use your fingers to quickly shape the dough into a bagel formation. 

After the bagels were correctly formed, I broiled them for 2 minutes on each side in order to form a crunchy crust around the bagels. I hoped this would help the bagels hold up during boiling and make the final product more edible.

<h2> Step 6 </h2>

While the bagels were broiling for 2 minutes on each side, I got a big pot of water with salt and honey boiling on the stove. When the bagel was done broiling, I individually placed each bagel in the boiling pot of water. I cooked each bagel for 1 minute before flipping and cooking for another minute on the other side. 

After the 2 minutes were up, I removed the bagel from the boiling water and continued to cook the other bagels in the same manner.

<h2> Step 7 </h2>

After all the bagels had been boiled, I put them in the oven for about 5 minutes on each side, until the bagels were crusty and "bagel-like". I believe one of the mistakes I may have made was overcooking them... so maybe avoid putting them into the oven if you are thinking of recreating this recipe. 

Ultimately, I was able to eat one of the bagels right after they came out of the oven and it was ok. But within a few hours these bagels had become rock hard and were completely inedible.
