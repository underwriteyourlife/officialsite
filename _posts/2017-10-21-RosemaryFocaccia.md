# Rosemary Focaccia
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Meal Prep/Week6/Rosemary Focaccia/Final Product 400x250.jpg">

I knew I needed a side-dish to go along with my [Week 6](http://underwriteyourlife.com/meal%20prep/Week6/) lunch, and I knew I had left-over rosemary from making [Rosemary Rolls](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Rosemary-Honey-Pull-Apart-Rolls/) so I thought a rosemary focaccia would be a great idea!

However, my ridiculously hung-over self did not stop to think that I was also planning on making [pizza](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Pizza/) for lunch this week and that pizza + bread might be /too/ many carbs for one meal. Luckily, I am signed-up to run a 5k this weekend so I have a somewhat legitimate excuse to "carboload". 

Anyways, here's how I went about baking these beauts-

In total, this made 10 servings of about 2in-by-4in slices. Perfect to go alongside a dish! Plus, the salt content helps prevent it from going bad, so they'll last all week. 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

I'd bet you can't guess what I did first... that's right... I rose the yeast. As usual, I dissolved one packet of yeast in .5 cups of water and poured in 1 tbsp of honey. The sugar from the honey helps the yeast rise. 

While the yeast activates (just let it sit there for about 5 minutes to get fluffy), I chopped the rosemary. 

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Once the yeast looked bubbly, I added the oil, chopped rosemary, salt, and the rest of the honey then stirred to incorporate.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the mixture is fully stirred, I added flour .5 cups at a time, until I was no longer able to stir the mixture with a spoon. Once it became too difficult to stir, I dumped the dough out on the counter. For me, this was after ~2 cups of flour, however, it will depend on the amount of water/oil you use.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

I added a little bit of flour to my hands and then proceeded to knead the dough for about 5 minutes, just until the mixture was no longer sticky. I usually can tell the dough is done because when I poke it, it holds its shape. 

Then I put it in an oiled bowl, in a warm location, to rise for about 1 hour.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

After the dough had doubled in size, I re-kneaded only until the dough was reincorporated then laid the dough out into a baking pan. Focaccia is intended to be a fluffy, thin, bread that is baked with salt and oil. Therefore, I found a pan that allowed for my dough to be about 1/4th an inch thick when rolled out. 

I rolled out the dough into this pan and let it rise again for about half an hour.

<h2> Step 6 </h2>

Once the dough had risen to my satisfaction, I went ahead and topped it with sea salt and oil then popped it into a pre-heated oven (~350 degrees) for 20 minutes, until golden-brown.

The toppings can be important for the success of focaccia. In order to make this recipe a little bit healthier, I cut back on the amount of oil in the dough itself. However, traditional focaccia can use upwards of 1/3rd a cup of olive oil per loaf, so if you are not as concerned with the oil content feel free to add more to suit your tastes. Lastly, the sea salt was also a vital ingredient to determine the final flavor. Adding the salt on top helps ensure the bread will not go bad over the course of the week and makes it taste less plain.
