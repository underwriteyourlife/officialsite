So for week 4 I decided to stir up a few new dishes that I am very excited to dig into!
I will be posting about how each of them held out throughout the week this weekend (including photos!) so be sure to check back. 

First, I decided to stew some [coconut curry lentils with cilantro white rice](http://underwriteyourlife.com/coconutcurrylentils/ "Coconut Curry Lentils") for dinner. While that was cooking, I whipped up some [chicken curry salad](http://underwriteyourlife.com/chickencurrysalad/ "Chicken Curry Salad") for lunch, then finished with some seasonal [pumpkin-spiced bread rolls](http://underwriteyourlife.com/pumpkinrolls/ "Pumpkin Spiced Bread Rolls"). I claim the bread rolls are for breakfast, but I definitely can't resist eating a few of them after dinner as well. They are delicious! The week cost a total of $2.11 per meal and all together represent 1366 kcal/day (377 for chicken curry salad, 656 for coconut lentils, and 333 for 4 bread rolls).

In case you don't want to click on each recipe individually, all the ingredients you'll need to make this week's meal prep are below:

$2.11 (if you only count the traditional dishes as meals)

For me, it produced 6 lunches and 6 dinners. If you are looking to increase your calories, or if you think that may not be enough, you can always add more lean meats for protein or make double.
