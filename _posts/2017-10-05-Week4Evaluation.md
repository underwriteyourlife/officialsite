title: Week 4 Evaluation
---

So here we are, lets take a look at how our dishes held up throughout Week 4. 

Chicken Curry Salad:
This was by far the best prepped meal I have made to date. I was a little afraid that the chicken was going to go bad by the end of the week, but in actuality, as the curry sat longer, the chicken marinated in the sauce and became more delicious! I purchased and cooked the chicken breasts on a Saturday afternoon, and it lasted until the following Friday at lunchtime with no problems and without going sour.
