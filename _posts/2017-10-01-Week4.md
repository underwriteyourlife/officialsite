# Week 4 Meal Prep

So for week 4 I decided to stir up a few new dishes that I am very excited to dig into!

First, I decided to stew some [coconut curry lentils with cilantro white rice](/recipe/CoconutCurryLentils/ "Coconut Curry Lentils") for dinner. While that was cooking, I whipped up some [chicken curry salad](/recipe/ChickenCurrySalad/ "Chicken Curry Salad") for lunch, then finished with some seasonal [pumpkin-spiced bread rolls](/recipe/PumpkinRolls/ "Pumpkin Spiced Bread Rolls"). I claim the bread rolls are for breakfast, but I definitely can't resist eating a few of them after dinner as well. They are delicious! The week cost a total of ~$2.29 per meal. Check below for the macro and calorie breakdown:
