# Baguettes

Since I knew I wasn't going to be eating these fresh (they were served alongside my [veggie lasagna](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Veggie-Lasagna/) in this week's meal prep), I did a variation on a traditional baguette that had a little more flavor. To me, the best thing about baking your own bread is seeing how cheap it is. After you make your first baguette I have no doubt that you won't waste money again buying day-old bread at the grocery store: the total price of this recipe, which makes 2 baguettes, is .82 cents. With 8 servings of 2 1-inch slices each, that is 10 cents per serving!

These were a great addition to the lasagna for a truly Italian-style lunch. [Click here](http://underwriteyourlife.com/meal%20prep/Week-9-Evaluation/) to see how the baguettes held up over the course of the week.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Firstly, add 1 packet of active dry yeast to a bowl and pour in .5 cups of WARM water. The water must feel warm to the touch, but if it is too hot then it may kill the yeast (this will cause your bread to not rise properly). Gently stir to mix the yeast with the warm water, adding in 3tsp of sugar to help the yeast rise. 

Wait about 5 minutes. If your mixture becomes bubbly/fluffy then that's how you know your yeast has fully activated. If it does not visibly change within 10 minutes, it is likely that your yeast did not activate and you should start over with a new yeast packet. 

Once your yeast is activated, add one egg and salt, then stir to mix.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Add flour, .5 cups at a time, until you can no longer stir with a spoon. For me this was about after 2.5 cups of flour. Then pour the dough and remaining flour onto a floured work surface for kneading.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Gently knead the dough, adding flour as necessary until the dough does not stick to your hands. I used about 3.2 cups of flour total in making the dough, but the amount may vary. Use your judgement- the dough should be soft but not stick to your hands when you roll it. 

Let the dough rest for 1 hour, until it has doubled in size.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Once the dough has finished rising, re-roll it out on a floured countertop. Divide the dough in half and use the palm of your hands to roll out each individual section into a long cylinder. 

Cut down the middle of the cylinder with a knife, to give the bread a uniquely "baguette-ish" style. 

Bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes, until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when you tap on it.
