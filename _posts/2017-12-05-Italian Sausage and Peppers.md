# Italian Sausage and Peppers

This is, according to the internet and this [AllRecipes recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/76808/italian-sausage-peppers-and-onions/), a traditional Italian dish. I do occasionally like to pretend that I have some Italian heritage, so I figured this would be easy enough to tackle. 

The best thing about this dish to me was the fact that it used the sausage that I got so cheaply last week and tasted so flavorful that I actually looked forward to eating it for dinner each night. I served the sausage and peppers alongside some rice because... rice.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

The first thing I did was cook up my sausages in a pan with a little bit of oil. I cooked them just until they were about 3/4ths cooked- 5 or so minutes. While the sausages were cooking, I chopped the peppers, onions, and garlic. Additionally, I went ahead and put the rice in my rice cooker so it would be ready for serving when the sausage was finished.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Once the sausages were cooked, I went ahead and sliced/weighed them to get an accurate calorie count. 

Next, I cooked the peppers and onions as well as the white wine vinegar in the pan for about 5-7 minutes until the onions were translucent. It should smell delicious! I think I am just a huge fan of white wine vinegar, but after cooking down the peppers in it, it should smell like you are ready to chow down.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the peppers were cooked, I added seasonings/spices, the can of diced tomatoes, as well as the cooked sausage. I stirred to incorporate and continued to cook for another 10 minutes until the sausages were fully cooked.

That's it! I served them alongside some white rice.
