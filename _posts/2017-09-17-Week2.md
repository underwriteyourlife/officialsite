# Week 2 Meal Prep

For my second week of full meal prep, I decided to try to make something that would take less time than last week. And while I was wrong about it taking less time than usual, the meals themselves were pretty decent! For breakfast I made [Oatmeal Banana Raisin Muffins](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/), followed by easy [Chicken Chili](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/) for lunch, then a heaping serving of [Poor Man's Pad Thai](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/PoorManPadThai/) for dinner. 

As a side, I included some baby carrots and a serving of [seasoned roasted russet potatoes](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/RoastedSeasonedPotatoes/). These expenses are not included in the ingredient breakdown below, but increase the price per serving by ~.70 cents (10 servings). 

As with meal prep weeks 1-3, I didn't take photos of anything except for the end product so I apologize for the lack of photos for the recipes. If I make them again I will be sure to come back and update their postings so there are nicer visuals to accompany the instructions!

[Read my review](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/) about how Week 2's meals held up!
