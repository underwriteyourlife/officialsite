# Week 2 Meal Prep

For my second week of full meal prep, I decided to try to make something that would take less time than last week. And while I was wrong about it taking less time than usual, the meals themselves were pretty decent! For breakfast I made [Oatmeal Banana Raisin Muffins](/recipe/OatmealBananaRaisinMuffin/), followed by easy [Chicken Chili](/recipe/ChickenChili/) for lunch, then a heaping serving of [Poor Man's Pad Thai](/recipe/PoorManPadThai/) for dinner. 

As with meal prep weeks 1-3, I didn't take photos of anything except for the end product so I apologize for the lack of photos for the recipes. If I make them again I will be sure to come back and update their postings so there are nicer visuals to accompany the instructions!

[Read my review](https://underwriteyourlife.github.io/meal%20prep/Week4Evaluation/) about how Week 2's meals held up!
