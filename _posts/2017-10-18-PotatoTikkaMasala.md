# Potato Tikka Masala

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Meal Prep/Week6/Potato Tikka Masala/final product.jpg"

This is a story. So last Friday, over my lunch break while chowing down on some [chicken curry salad](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/ChickenCurrySalad/) I came across [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/239867/chef-johns-chicken-tikka-masala/) by Chef John. It looked delicious and different than the curries I have made in the past, so I decided I would give it a shot this week for my meal prep dinner. 

There was just one problem... Chef John was using Chicken in his Tikka Masala. My penny-pinching butt thought that I could save a few dollars by replacing the chicken with potatoes. Genius! (or so I thought)

All-in-all, while I am categorizing this as a ["recipe failure"](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipesforfailure/) since it definitely does not taste like traditional tikka masala, it is still completely edible and I am committed to eating it throughout the week. In fact, as I am writing this on a Tuesday, it's actually been pretty good so far! Just not what I was expecting.

TO BE ADDED


<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Firstly, I got a big pot of water boiling in which I could soak my rice noodles. Since we are going to 'stir-fry' them later, I brought the water to a boil, turned off the heat, added the noodles, and just let them soak for about 5-6 minutes. Once they were finished soaking, I drained them and let them cool (no need to wash the pot yet- we are going to use it later!) 

While the noodles were soaking, I chopped my onions, carrots, and green onions.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Next, I added my olive oil and garlic to a large pan to sauté. After about a minute, when the pan was fully heated, I added the onion and carrots and let the whole dish sauté over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. 

After the carrots and onion were cooked, I cracked 1 fresh egg into the pan, turned off the burner, and let the residual heat slowly cook the egg.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the egg was no longer runny, I used the same large pot in which I soaked the noodles to make the sauce. Firstly, I put .5 cups of water and 1 vegetable bouillon cube into the pot. If you do not have bouillon cubes, you can use .5-1 cups of vegetable/chicken broth. Once the cube is dissolved (or broth heated), move on to the next step.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Collect your remaining ingredients and prepare to add them, one at a time, to the bouillon broth. This means adding 2 tbsp honey, 3 tsp fish sauce, 3 tbsp peanut butter, 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 4 tbsp soy sauce, and the juice of 1 lime into the pot. Let this mixture come to a slow simmer before moving on. 

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

Once the peanut butter is melted and the whole broth is simmering, feel free to give it a taste and adjust to your personal preferences. I tend to add more rice vinegar, but it is completely up to you! If the smell of fish sauce does not turn you off too much, adding more fish sauce will give the Pad Thai a more authentic taste.  

Next, add the onion/carrot/egg sautéed mixture into the sauce and cook for 1 minute.

Once that is fully incorporated, add the cooked rice noodles along with a little bit of olive oil and 1 tbsp soy sauce to the pot and stir until the rice noodles are coated.

<h2> Step 6 </h2>

Lastly, I added 1/4 cup of salted peanuts into a ziplock bag and used a rolling pin to crush them. I then took the crushed peanuts, roasted them over high heat for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, then used them as garnish for the top of the Pad Thai. In my opinion, roasted peanuts not only smell amazing but provide a really nice crunch to the dish! This is especially important because as the week progresses and the flavors begin to mix, the peanuts will diversify the texture of your meal.

Then you are all done! Serve the Pad Thai in separate dishes, topped with peanuts/cilantro/green onion/lime wedge as you see fit.

For my week 5 meal prep, I made this dish with a side of [roasted thyme potatoes](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/RoastedSeasonedPotatoes/).
