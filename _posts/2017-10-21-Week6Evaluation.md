# Week 6 Meal Prep Evaluation

This week was relatively uneventful as the meals unfolded. For the most part, there wasn't much variation in terms of the visual appeal or flavor of the dishes. If you haven't already, [check out what I made this week](http://underwriteyourlife.com/meal%20prep/Week6/) before reading on. 

# [Potato Tikka Masala](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/PotatoTikkaMasala/):

One of the great things about using potato instead of meat is that you know it'll hold up without going bad. This was definitely the case for this week, as the photos imply. Visually, the Potato Tikka Masala looked as good on Day 1 as it did on Day 5, and although the flavor did not change, if you read the recipe you already know that it didn't exactly taste like "tikka masala". Probably my fault for using the coconut milk, but what can I say? Coconut milk is so trendy right now. 

One thing worth noting with all my meal-preps that come with a side of rice: the rice does get stiff. I never thought it was worth mentioning before since most people who cook rice know that it needs to be reheated before eating, but for the record, I do not reccomend making this meal and expecting to eat it without heating it up first. As you can see from my photo below, I use a pan to reheat my dinner (since I don't own a microwave). After giving a few minutes for the rice to heat up with the potato tikka masala sauce, it's completely edible. 

I'm sure it would be just fine in a microwave, but since I haven't been able to try it, I can't say for sure. 

# [Homemade Pizza](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Pizza/) (and [Muffzas!](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Muffzas/) )

I feel like anyone who has eaten cold pizza out of the refrigerator already knows what I am going to say. Of course the Pizza and Muffzas lasted well throughout the week! I even had some left-over that I ate *9 days* after baking and it was still good. The Muffzas dough did get a little hard (because it was so thick) but otherwise, man, my lunches were delicious. 

Warning: Your coworkers/friends may judge you 

# [Rosemary Focaccia](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/RosemaryFocaccia/):

Out of all the breads I have made so far for meal-prep, this held up the best by far. I think it was from the additional salt both in the dough and on top of the bread that allowed it to keep its flavor without going bad. 

I stored half of my Focaccia in my meal-prep 'lunch boxes' which were placed in the refrigerator and the other half in ziplock baggies. There was no substantial difference in texture or flavor between the two, other than the fact that the Focaccia was obviously colder when I kept it in the fridge. 

While I try to avoid using the microwaves at work for lunch, I did find that microwaving the meal prep box (both pizza and focaccia included) made everything a little softer and more like when it had just been baked. However, I actually preferred the dishes cold because I like the extra chewiness.
