# Sweet and Sour Chicken

Anyone that knows me well knows that I have a horrible sweet tooth. I would gladly eat dessert instead of dinner if I could sustain myself for more than a couple weeks. In this vain, I thought I would try to tackle a sweet and sour chicken dish with brown rice this week. I didn't follow any one recipe in order to make this dish- once I got the idea of using pineapple in chicken, I just kinda added what sounded good. 

The result wasn't bad! It is definitley sweet but not overwhelming. The rice vinegar and soy sauce help cut the flavor and the added protien from the chicken and brown rice makes it super filling. The one thing I would do differently in the future is to use pineapple chunks instead of crushed pineapple.

In total, the recipe made me 5 servings of Sweet and Sour Chicken. Each serving is 581 calories, with 39g Protien, 87g Carbs, and 10g Fat, costing $2.60. 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Firstly, go ahead and cook your chicken (or other protein). I add 1 tbsp oil to a pan an sear the chicken until it is about 3/4ths cooked. It is ok if you cook it all the way through to ensure your chicken will not be raw, but it will be cooked again later. 

Once it is cooked, go ahead and use a fork and knife to chop the chicken up into bite-sized pieces.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

While the chicken is cooking, use this opportunity to chop your bell pepper, onion, green onion, garlic, ginger, and any other toppings you may choose to add.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once your ingredients are chopped and your chicken is cooked, use the same pan to begin to make the sauce. Go ahead and add your remaining 1tbsp of oil to the pan and gently sautee the garlic over medium heat. Once the pan is fully heated (only about 30 seconds), add your green bell pepper and give it a stir. Immediately add the chopped onion and stir-fry the mixture until the onions are transparent (about 5-7 minutes).

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

After the onion and peppers have been cooked, add the carrots and chopped pineapple along with 50% of the pineapple juice from the can of pineapple (~1 cup).

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

Let the whole mixture simmer over medium heat until the pineapple juice has mostly evaporated and the meal has a thick and meaty consistency (~15-20 minutes).

Lastly, add your chopped chicken along with the remaining seasonings (the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and salt/pepper to taste) and give the mixture a big stir until everything is incorporated. Serve with a side of brown rice.
