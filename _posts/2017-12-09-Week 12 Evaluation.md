# Week 12 Meal Prep Evaluation

Honestly, with the exception of the Italian Sausage and Potatoes, I don't think I will be making this week again. The "soup" was flat week over week 

# [Italian Sausage and Peppers](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Italian-Sausage-and-Peppers/)

Yummy, yummy, yummy. Sausage doesn't really go bad in the refrigerator (at least not over a week) and the rice I bought this last time was less sticky than previously. This dish tasted as good on Monday as it did on Friday. I added lots of spices, and the combination of these spices with the fire roasted diced tomato made sure that it tasted strongly all week. 

Nothing big to report here- it was a solid meal prep meal.

# [Italian Wedding Soup](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Italian-Wedding-Soup/) with [French Baguette](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Baguettes/)

No. Just no. 

This was definitley my fault for trying to replace the bad ground beef with more pasta, but the pasta soaked up the liquid throughout the week which really just made this mushy pasta. I reluctantly ate it for lunch, but the French baguettes were the saving grace. They did get a little hard over the week, but I dipped them in the "soup" and it was ok. 

Just stay away from this one.
