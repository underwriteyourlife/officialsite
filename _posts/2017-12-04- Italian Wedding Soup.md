# Italian Wedding Soup

When I was a kid, my dad would take my sister and I to the Spaghetti Warehouse occasionally during the summer. While the spaghetti was good, my dad always went because they had an "unlimited Italian wedding soup" deal with each spaghetti purchase. The soup was absolutely delicious, and I will never forget my dad's joke that the waitress should just hook him up to an IV of the stuff because he ate so much. 

That was the feeling I was going for when I decided to try to make some wedding soup... but it wasn't the recipe that kept me from hitting my target. Unfortunately, my ground beef for the meatballs had gone bad. It wasn't until after cooking them up that I realized I really shouldn't try to eat them. 

So this post is for the recipe that should have been- just note that because I didn't have the meatballs, I actually ended up adding in extra pasta. The pasta soaked up the soup and it ended up being more of a pasta and spinach dish than an Italian Wedding Soup. So I failed but this recipe /might/ be salvageable.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

The first thing I did was chop my onions and get my chicken broth boiling over low heat on my stove top.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

As the liquid was heating up, I went ahead and made the meatballs. I could smell that the meat wasn't very good, but I didn't realize it until after they were done cooking. It was a pretty time-intensive process so the fact that I couldn't include them was a little depressing. 

Anyways... I combined the panko, eggs, and meat together and then shaped them into little balls. If you were making this with good meat, then after cooking the balls in a pan you would add them to the broth in the next step.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the meatballs were cooked and the broth was boiling, I added the onion and spinach to the soup base. I brought the whole mixture back up to a boil, added the pasta noodles, and then cooked until al dente. 

I served this "soup" alongside some [French baguettes](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Baguettes/) for my Week 12 meal prep.
