# Week 10 Meal Prep

This week I decided to take on some more macro-friendly meals as well as recreate a previous recipe from [Week 2](http://underwriteyourlife.com/meal%20prep/Week2/) with turkey instead of chicken. So for breakfast I took a swing and a miss at making [cinnamon raisin bagels](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Cinnamon-Raisin-Bagels/), for lunch I whipped up that delicious [turkey chili](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Turkey-Chili/), and for dinner I made a Japanese-style chicken and broccoli dish, [yakitori don](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Yakitori-Don/).

All together this week was a pretty good one! The bagels didn't go over too well, but the other two dishes were relatively safe and easy to make. At only $28 dollars for the week, or $5.56/day, I can't really complain! Plus, both these dishes are high in protein and lower-calorie, so you can eat a ton guilt-free.
