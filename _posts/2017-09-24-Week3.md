# Week 3 Meal Prep

This week I took a recipe from the <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com" target= "_blank"> Budget Bytes </a> playbook! If you haven't already seen her website, go check it out for more meal prep inspiration!

For lunch I cooked up a traditional [Mexican vegetable casserole](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/), followed by a traditional Indian dish [Chana Saag](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/), and then a show-stopping loaf or two of my all-time favorite bread [challah](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/). In addition to the Chana Saag, I also made my own [Naan](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/), which was suprisingly delicious. 

As of updating this post on 10/10/17, I can still say that this was my favorite meal prep week to date! None of the dishes dissapointed. 
[Read my review](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/) about how Week 3's meals held up!

I am counting this as a 10-serving week (as in 5 casserole lunches and 5 saag dinners), however, it definitley produced more than that. I was just so hungry after cooking all this up that I polished off the restof the Mexican Casseroles (likely around 1-2 servings) and froze the rest of the Chana Saag without thinking to measure out how much it /really/ produced.
