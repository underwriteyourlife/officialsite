# Week 3 Meal Prep

This week I took a recipe from the <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com" target= "_blank"> Budget Bytes </a> playbook! If you haven't already seen her website, go check it out for more meal prep inspiration!

For lunch I cooked up a traditional [Mexican vegetable casserole](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/), followed by a traditional Indian dish [Chana Saag](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/), and then a show-stopping loaf or two of my all-time favorite bread [challah](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/). In addition to the Chana Saag, I also made my own [Naan](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/), which was suprisingly delicious. 

As of updating this post on 10/10/17, I can still say that this was my favorite meal prep week to date! None of the dishes dissapointed. 
[Read my review](http://underwriteyourlife.com/comingsoon/) about how Week 3's meals held up!
