# Jambalaya

Just when I thought I had already made every rice dish in the book, BAM, I remember I forgot about the Creole classic: Jambalaya. Sadly, I went to Trader Joes before my local grocery store this time, so I got some Chicken Andouille Sausage at TJ before realizing  that my other store was having a massive sausage sale (ha ha). So I picked up the giant package of "hot Italian sausage" in the photo below for $2.75! But I only ended up using the chicken sausage in this dish- hopefully I can think of some good recipes for the Italian sausage in the future. 
 
This recipe made me 5 servings of Chicken Sausage Jambalaya for $3.20 per meal (including a side of chips) and a total of 630 calories each. It definitely would have been cheaper if I had used my sale-sausage instead of the andouille, but I think I deserve a little splurge this week. I made this dish as part of my [week 11] meal prep, so I actually ended up freezing these servings to eat the following week.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Go ahead and chop your onion, pepper, green onion, celery, garlic, and sausage.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Add the oil and chopped sausage to a pan and cook according to the sausage instructions. In my case, I cooked for a total of 7 minutes until the chicken sausage was cooked entirely through. Once the sausage is cooked, take the chopped links out, being sure to leave the extra fat and oil in the pan.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Next, with the old oil and fat still in the plan, add your chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Add in the chopped veggies (leaving the green onion on the side) and seasoning then cook for 8 minutes. The veggies should be tender and fully cooked before moving onto the next step.

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

Once the veggies are fully cooked, add the tomato with diced green chilies and stir to incorporate.

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

At this point I realized that if I was going to be cooking rice in this pot that it was wayyy too small. So, I moved the veggie/tomato mixture into a big pot before trying to cook the rice. Once it was moved into the big pot, I added the chicken broth and brown rice, covered with a lid, and let simmer for 20 minutes. 

I cooked, stirring occasionally, until the rice was soft and edible. Since this was part of my week 11 meal prep I decided to freeze the jambalaya until after Thanksgiving to eat the next week, so I divided out the jambalaya into 5 servings in ziplock baggies and froze them.
