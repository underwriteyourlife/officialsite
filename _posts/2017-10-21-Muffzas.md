# Muffzas (Muffin Pizzas)
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Meal Prep/Week6/Pizza/Final Product.jpg">

This was one of those times that I thought I was being really innovative and creative, when I was really just trying to take a short-cut by putting the pizza dough into a muffin pan and thinking it would make tiny, bite-sized, pizzas. While it wasn't a complete disaster, I am not making these instead of regular [pizza](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Pizza/) next time.

A lot of this post will be repetitive because I used the same recipe as for my homemade pizza, I just shaped it differently. Regardless, ingredients are below:

I used the same type of dough as I did for my [pizza](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Pizza/), so the first two steps are the same: 

<h2> Step 1 </h2>

Firstly, as with every week where I bake something, I had to rise the yeast. I added about .5 cups of warm water to 1 packet of yeast and sprinkled in a few pinches of sugar to help it activate. 

Once the yeast activated (let it sit for about 5 minutes and get fluffy), I added the oil and salt then stirred the whole mixture.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>

Once the oil is added, I added flour, .5 cups at a time, to the mixture. 

After about 1.5 cups of flour the mixture was too dense to stir in the bowl so I rolled it out on the counter top and kneaded it until it was sticky but held it's shape. 

<figure class="third">

Let the rolled flour rise for about 1 hour in a oiled bowl until doubled in size.

<h2> Step 3 </h2>

Once the dough finished rising and I reached down for my baking sheet, I noticed my poor, unused, muffin tin sitting at the bottom of my cabinet. I thought to myself: "What if I just flattened out the dough into the muffin sheets and made mini muffin pizzas?" It seemed like a great idea at the time, so I went ahead with the plan. 

I pulled off sections of the dough and used my fingers to flatten (as much as possible) the dough into the individual muffin holes.

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Meal Prep/Week6/Pizza Bites/2 Unbaked Dough.jpg">

</figure>

<h2> Step 4 </h2>

I then put the muffin tin into the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes, just to let the dough harden a bit before adding my cheese and pasta sauce. 

As you can see by the photos below, when I took the tin out of the oven, that was when I realized I had made a bit of an error in both judgement and execution.

</figure>

<h2> Step 5 </h2>

So when the dough came out, the yeast had fluffed-up the crust way more than I was expecting. I actually laughed out loud at myself because what did I think was going to happen??

But the damage had been done at this point, and I was committed to making this edible. So I used a spoon and carved a little hole out of the center of the Muffzas to fill them with pizza sauce and sprinkled them with cheese. 

I then baked them again for about 20 minutes until I was convinced the super-bready Muffzas were thoroughly cooked through.

So there you have it, Muffzas. They tasted like really really thick crust pizza, which (as you can see from my Week 6 meal prep) I do not have a problem with the added carbs. I included the photos above so you have proof that I ate them... or at least a bite of one...
