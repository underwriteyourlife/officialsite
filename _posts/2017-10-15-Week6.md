# Week 6 Meal Prep

This weekend was not a great weekend for me to be cooking. I was pretty hungover from a work outing the night before and the last thing I wanted to do was try to find a parking spot in the WAY TOO SMALL Trader Joe's lot. Regardless, meal prep was calling and I knew I had to answer. 

However, that did not mean that I had to pretend to be happy about it! Therefore, I went ahead and made [Pizza](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/Pizza/), [Muffzas](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/Muffzas/) and [Focaccia](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe/RosemaryFocaccia/) for lunch this week. 

I'm an adult. I can make these decisions. 

That being said, I did try something more ambitious for dinner. I attempted my take on a [potato tikka masala](http://underwriteyourlife.com/recipe%20failure/PotatoTikkaMasala/) that had all the makings of a delicious Indian dish but with the execution of a hungover 23-year old White girl. Thankfully, I got some great feedback when I posed this recipe to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/780gey/week_6_22meal_1300_kcal/) so I hope I can revisit this idea later and truly make something worthwhile.
