### More Information ###

My name is Emily, and I am *NOT* a personal financial advisor. In fact, I'm not even a personal financial planner, CPA, or any other three letter acronym that could somehow qualify me to create a blog based on personal finance. My very loose qualifications are that I have an undergraduate degree in finance and a passion for personal financial planning. 

The more I studied finance the more I discovered that the entire financial industry seemed to be built on the premise of convincing people (especially women) that finance is too <em> hard</em> for them to tackle alone, thus you must pay someone to handle it on your behalf. 

**This is not true!**

I truly believe that for the majority of people in the world, personal finances can be handled efficiently and effectively all on their own. You don't need to pay an expensive personal financial advisor or planner to help you with your financial goals! The hardest part is taking the first step, and I hope this blog will help inspire some people to begin to do that.

Along the way, I plan on sharing some of my own tricks to saving money (like cooking cheap, delicious, meals) in order to help people take control of their financial futures.
